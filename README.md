## Overview

FaLC enables simulations of the (future) development of population, jobs, construction, real estate demand, transport, and their interaction effects. The models include a large amount of information: for example, age and income of residents, commuting ties as well as the spatial distribution of the companies in various industries. 

## Templates

Templates are sample projects runnable by FaLC. Each project contains configuration configuration directory "properties" and database directory "db". 
Database contains population, distances and base probability tables stored as CSV files.
