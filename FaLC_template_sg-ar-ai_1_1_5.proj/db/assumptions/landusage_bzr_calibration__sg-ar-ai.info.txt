higher occupied Floor Area than maximum Floor Area in starting year:
obzFA(𝓁,u)	Floor Area outside the considered zoning plan (by location 𝓁, use type u)


The assumed Utilization Factors (UF) showed to be too low in large cities (where land use regulation tend to allow more dense settlement) and in agricultural villages (with a relatively large number of residents and employees located outside the officially designated building zones. 
Generally, this leads already in the starting year to a higher occupied Floor Area than the maximum Floor Area allowed in the zone. In the following years, these locations loose year by year households and firms. 
To handle this, the three rules have been amended by an additional Floor Area representing the floor area not covered by the zoning plan (and the according assumptions in FaLC).
(for details: see Bodenmann et al. 2014)


locid	  id of location 𝓁
denot	  name of location 𝓁
obzfa_r	  Floor Area outside the considered zoning plan for residential use
obzfa_j	  Floor Area outside the considered zoning plan for jobs
obzfa_r_j Floor Area outside the considered zoning plan fur residential use and jobs

In the current implementation, obzFA(𝓁,u)  was calculated based on the status in 2000. 
Additionally, we assumed that the maximum Floor Area is at least 10% higher than the occupied Floor Area in year 2000.
